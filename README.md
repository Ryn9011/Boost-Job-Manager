Accounts:

user: boost 
password: password

user: lion
password: password

Current Functionality:

The boost account can create and edit jobs whilst the lion account only has limited editing.

Changes can be made to jobs by Boost by clicking the job#. Any changes made are added to
the job modification section. A summary of changes can then be sent via email to Lion
(disabled). The details of the modifications are also sent to the lion account as notifications
in the form of a mailbox.
